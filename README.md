 This web application allows users to convert currencies and get real-time exchange rates. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application fetches data from an external API to provide accurate currency conversion. 
 Also, I used typescript for this mini-project for the first time, which was amazing.
 
## Technologies Used 
 
- **HTML**: Structure of the web application. 
- **CSS**: Styling of the application for a better user experience. 
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for fetching exchange rates and dynamic updates. 
- **TypeScript**: This is for type safety and better code structure (optional). 
- **FontAwesome**: For icons used in the application. 
- **ExchangeRate API**: For fetching real-time currency exchange rates.
